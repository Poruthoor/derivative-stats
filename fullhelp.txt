This script takes arbitrary numbers of files containing your Free Energy
Curves (FECs) and a file prefix to write output files to. The output file
must be the first argument; the average/unified FEC must be the second. The
leading bin edge is expected to be in the first column and the free energy of
that bin is expected to be the second. None of the other columns, if there
are any, are used explicitly.

This script computes a difference between neighboring points on an FEC,
scaled by the distance between points (a numerical derivative), from a FEC
between each replica and the FEC representing pooled/unified/average values.
The distance between points (bin width) is assumed to be constant. It uses
these deviations to calculate a standard deviation for each difference,
writes that standard error to a file. Note it will have one fewer entry than
the number of bins provided.

It also calculates a collection of integrals (using the trapezoid method)
over the windows used to produce the reaction coordinate, then computes their
standard deviation. This is an approximate way of associating variability to
a particular window. Because the integrals are over segments of the
derivative they are in free energy units. This script assumes your windows
are evenly spaced along the reaction coordinate, computing where their
'edges' are by subtracting the first bin from the last bin to determine the
length of the reaction coordinate, then dividing by the window count. It also
assumes that you've dropped half a window at each end of the reaction
coordinate to avoid edge effects. Future schemes will allow user
specification of 'bin edges' for this purpose.

NOTE: ORDER IS IMPORTANT. THE OUTFILE IS OVERWRITTEN IN AN INDISCRIMINATE
FASHION. DON'T PUT A FILE IN THE OUTFILE POSITION IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT.
