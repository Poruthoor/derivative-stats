Script takes arbitrary numbers of files containing your Free Energy Curves
(FECs) and one filename to write to. The output file must be the first
argument; the average/unified FEC must be the second. The leading bin edge is
expected to be in the first column and the free energy of that bin is
expected to be the second. None of the other columns, if there are any, are
used explicitly.

This script computes a difference between neighboring points on an FEC, scaled by the
distance between points (a numerical derivative), from a FEC between each
replica and the FEC representing pooled/unified/average values. The distance between points (bin width) is assumed to be constant. It uses these
deviations to calculate a standard error for each difference, writes that
standard error to a file. Note it will have one fewer entry than the number
of bins provided.

It also calculates a collection of integrals over the windows used to produce the reaction coordinate. This winds up being analogous to locally`

NOTE: ORDER IS IMPORTANT. THE OUTFILE IS OVERWRITTEN IN AN INDISCRIMINATE
FASHION. DON'T PUT A FILE IN THE OUTFILE POSITION IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT.
